# PyramidRouteFinder

PyramidRouteFinder is a simple library that allows finding longest (largest) 
paths in pyramid shaped integer data.
The project was created as a coding exercise in writing maintainable C# algorithms.

## Setup

I recommend using JetBrains Rider in order to fully take advantage 
of type annotations in the project, however can also be simply run with Visual Studio.

## Usage

```C#
using PyramidRouteFinderLib;
â€¦

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            const string path = "some/path.txt";
            //Instantiate
            var finder = new RouteFinder();
            //Extract route
            var route = finder.FindNumericalRouteFromFile(path);

        }

```
